One Problem → One Solution - Confused prospects don't reply
70-95 Words Optimal - Peak performance range from data
Casual Tone Wins - Conversational beats corporate

Give Before You Get - Value first, ask second

KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

70-95 words optimal - Never exceed 125
Specific trigger required - Generic = <5% replies
ONE problem, ONE solution, ONE CTA - Clarity wins
70/30 them/you ratio - Make it about them
Judge harshly - Most emails are terrible
Data backs every change - No opinions, only proven patterns
Personality matters - Humans reply to humans
Give value regardless - Make them smarter even if no reply
Conversation > meeting - Lower the commitment bar
Test yourself - Would YOU reply to this?

The best cold emails feel like helpful messages from a knowledgeable peer who did their homework. Make every prospect think: "This person gets it."
Success Formula: Right Person + Right Time + Right Message + Low Friction = Response
