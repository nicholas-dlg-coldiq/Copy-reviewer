# COLD EMAIL BEST PRACTICES (ColdIQ Framework - Condensed)

## Core Principles

**Personalization**
- NO generic AI compliments - use custom prompts, not templates
- Focus on interests/facts prospects consistently care about
- Reference specific, recent info (funding, hiring, product launches, time in business)
- Avoid sounding like what they already have in place
- Make it worth their time - say it like a human, say what competitors can't say

**Subject Lines**
- Under 50 characters
- Add space before subject for pattern interrupt
- Avoid spam triggers (free, guaranteed, urgent)
- Use curiosity/relevance, not clickbait
- Questions work (avoid overused "Quick question")

**Opening Hook**
- First sentence 100% about THEM, not you
- Lead with insight, observation, or connection
- Get to value within 2 sentences
- No fluff ("Hope you're well")
- Call out negatives to diffuse them
- Poke the Bear: Use Tweet-size illumination question that challenges their thinking

**Value Proposition**
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Quantify when possible (saved X hours, increased Y%)
- Make it situation-specific with social proof
- One clear value prop per email
- Avoid generic words (optimize, streamline, save time/money)
- Focus on what SUCKS about current solutions
- Don't make offers too good to be true

**Call to Action**
- Single, clear CTA - never multiple asks
- Low commitment (thoughts, quick chat, "Can I share how?")
- Avoid meetings in first touch
- Use "Worth a chat?" or "Worth exploring?"
- Give an out: "No worries if too busy"
- Focus on the conversation, not the call
- Ask if you can send content rather than pushing it

**Length & Structure**
- 70-95 words optimal, never exceed 125
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Skimmable in 10 seconds
- Write with an eraser - cut non-essentials
- Don't start with "Hi [First-Name]" like all other emails

**Tone & Style**
- Conversational, not formal - be cheeky, make them smile
- Show personality and authenticity
- Use humor in sign-offs: "Awaiting your fair but stern reply" or "Awaiting your profanity-filled response"
- Sent from a person with picture - feels human
- Casual writing is more relatable

## Critical DON'Ts

- Don't start with "I hope this email finds you well"
- No long paragraphs (3+ sentences)
- Never use more than one question mark
- Don't talk about yourself in first paragraph
- No generic templates that could apply to anyone
- No attachments in first email
- Don't follow up more than 3 times
- Don't use exclamation points excessively
- Never personalize like it's sent to 10,000+ people
- Don't lack a LinkedIn URL
- Avoid sensitive topics that sound fake

## Specificity & Credibility

- The more specific/crispy you are, the more credible you are
- Give an out: "Not sure it's a fit"
- Use social proof: "Result someone like me has that I want"
- Use specific numbers and data
- Reference exact challenges, not vague problems

## Psychological Triggers

- Use loss aversion ("You will LOSE X" > "You will GAIN X")
- Lower resistance - be curious, not pushy
- Create pattern interrupts
- Make people feel good - they'll want to respond
- Use "Not too different" persona: "I work with ICP similar to you"

## Personalization Signals & Triggers

**Product Changes:** Launches, new features, tech stack changes, platform migrations
**Content & Thought Leadership:** LinkedIn posts, blog articles, conference speaking, webinars, shared content
**Company News:** Press releases, awards, partnerships, customer success stories, industry recognition
**Competitive Signals:** Competitor activity, industry regulations, market shifts, competitor weaknesses
